# ENABLE - An all-inclusive E-platform

### Introduction - ENABLE

A lot of emphasis has been given to online classes and meeting during this lockdown period but three major issues we have faced is of internet stability, ability to memorize the explanation given during classes and lastly the drawback for differently abled. So we came up with the idea of Enable - a platform which converts speech to text which is used to create live transcripts which take lesser data and serve as real time notes so you don't need to memorize anything. This transcript also comes in printable braille and sign language variants to help the differently abled. We went another step further creating a sign language to text interpreter to help differently abled teachers.

### Challenges - ENABLE

The major challenge was to make this project light and not dependent on internet. So we had to use libraries which used minimum internet in order to carry out the task. We could not use any APIs as they'd require the use of internet. Secondly creating sign language transcripts was rather difficult because there wasn't any existing font for it and the ones which resembled closely weren't legible. So we had to scout images which were clear and could be used and yet maintain uniformity. The next challenge was the sign to text converter. We had to design a model what was fast and accurate to differentiate between words and spaces and we somehow did a decent job at it. Since it's already a challenge to create a level playing ground for those who are differently abled, we believe we did give a great start to the initiative to bring about some attention towards this as this might be the new normal for a while now.
